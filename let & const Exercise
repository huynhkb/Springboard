- What is the difference between ***var*** and ***let***?
    You can reassign and redeclare with var but you can only reassign with let. Var works in all scopes while let is code-block scoped only. 
- What is the difference between **var** and ***const***?
    Const you cannot redeclare nor reassign. Var works in all scopes while const is code-block scoped only. Also you can declare undefined with var but not with const.
- What is the difference between **let** and **const**?
    You can reassign with let but not with const. Also you can declare undefined with let but not with const.
- What is hoisting?
    Hoisting is how coding is compiled in the console. It reads the variable declaration and its values/content in order of top to bottom. When using var, you can access
    the variable name and it's undefined before it is used later on. Function declarations are also hoisted and can be invoked "before" they are defined in a codebase.
